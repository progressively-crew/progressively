# Technical stack

The long start includes a technical explanation of the stack and a step by step guide to setup the instance locally. It aims for comprehension of the project.

## The project

Progressively is one product that needs multiple tools to run on different platforms. Here is a list of what is needed to make it run from the user interface until finally reaching the databases.

### The dashboard (frontend)

The dashboard (the frontend) is built with [Remix.run](https://remix.run/), a [React](https://react.dev/) meta-framework. The tool is very practical for handling forms in an accessible way and for handling server side data fetching in a very effecient way.

The frontend project owns the End-To-End testing suites and we're using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to run them.

### The backend

The backend is built with [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) with REST APIs. To access the relational database, it uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

The backend also exposes a websocket endpoint for real-time updates and leverages [Redis pub/sub](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/) for horizontally scale the websocket connections.

### The databases

[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used for relational data and [Redis](https://redis.io/) is only use to scale the websocket connections.

## The repository

The project is a monorepo that uses [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [Turbo](https://turbo.build/) to manage the dependencies and workspaces. The goal is to be as consistent and as fast as possible.
