description: Configure your local env and generate Typescript types for a given env.
---

With Progressively, you can generate TypeScript types from a remote feature flag configuration. For instance, if your feature flag can have 3 variants `A`, `B`, `C`, then Progressively can generates type matching these three values.

To generate TypeScript types from the cli, you will use the following command:

```sh
$ progressively types
```

### The first run of the command

One the first run of the command, you will be asked to answer a bunch of questions to setup your local env in accordance to your Progressively instance. On subsequent run, types will be generated directly without asking anything.

```sh
$ progressively types

	You'll start the configuration of the Progressively CLI
	What is URL of your Progressively instance? https://progressively-backend.onrender.com
	
	What is your email? marvin.frachet@gmail.com
	What is your password? **************
	Authentication... done

	Your access token has been stored in the config located at ~/example/nextjs/config.json

	Current project : mfrachet.com

	Which env do you want to use? Production
	Secret key set up. You can now request your flags

	Your types file has been generated at ~/example/nextjs/node_modules/@types/@progressively/index.d.ts
```

### Subsequent runs

On subsequent run, you'll only be asked to choose a flag on the given environment and generate the types for it. If you want to change the active environment, you can run `$ progressively env`.

```sh
$ progressively types

	Your types file has been generated at ~/example/nextjs/node_modules/@types/@progressively/index.d.ts
```
