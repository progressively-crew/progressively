Progressively is a straightforward, lightweight, open-source, and self-hosted feature flag and analytics software. It streamlines feature releases with the simplicity of toggling a switch. Additionally, it provides a privacy-friendly analytics tool to help you better understand the impact of your feature flags.

## Why Progressively?


### Feature set

1. It comes with built-in feature flags & privacy-friendly analytics tooling, one tool, one place to check
2. It provides progressive rollout (percentage of the audience and/or qualitative criteria)
3. It comes with a CLI to drive the feature flags activation directly from the terminal
4. It provides scheduled feature flag activation capabilities
5. It can trigger webhooks when a flag is toggled

### Technically different

3. SDKs have a small surface API
4. It works in real-time with Websockets
5. It works on the server (for server side rendering for example)
6. Client side SDKs weights only 1.3kB

If you're not convinced yet, try to install it and play a little :).
