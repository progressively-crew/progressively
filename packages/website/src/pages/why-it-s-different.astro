          Webpage size is a trend. And we don't want to increase it with
          additional tooling. With this in mind, the React SDK for Progressively
          is only <ExternalLink

          >
            1.2Kb
          </ExternalLink>, which is order of magnitude smaller than other tools.

          It works on Edge runtime
        </h2>
        <p class="text-2xl leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
          You can use Progressively Server Side SDK on Edge runtime. Even more
          interesting: if you combine <ExternalLink

          You install the tool on your servers, you own the data. In the future,
          a SaaS might be available for users who prefer to use a ready to go
          service. If that's your case, please manifest your support on social
          channels.
