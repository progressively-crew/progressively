# Typescript TypeGen

With Progessively, you can dynamically create TypeScript types to integrate with the SDKs and benefit from flag name autocompletion and variant value autocompletion.

## Installation

Add the following environment variable. This is where the types will be pulled from.

```shell
PROGRESSIVELY_ENV="YOUR_OWN_KEY"
```

Install the typegen package:

```shell
$ npm install --save @progressively/typegen
```

## Usage

The package installation has brougth 2 binaries in your node modules: one to generate the dynamic types, and the other to restore to the initial values.

Generate the types:

```shell
progressively-gen-types
```

Restoring the default types:

```shell
progressively-restore-types
```
