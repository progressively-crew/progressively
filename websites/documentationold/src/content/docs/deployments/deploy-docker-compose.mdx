![Docker Compose](/compose.jpeg)

## Prerequisite

- A machine on which you can host the service
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on the machine
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on the machine


### Steps

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively
$ cd progressively
$ cp ./packages/database/.env.example ./packages/database/.env # modify the .env file with the connection string to postgres
$ cp ./websites/backend/.env.example ./websites/backend/.env
$ cp ./websites/frontend/.env.example ./websites/frontend/.env
```

At this point, you should modify the `./websites/backend/.env` and `./websites/frontend/.env` with your own defaults. You don't need to modify the database connection string for Postgres and Redis, the compose file takes care of that.

Then, run the following command:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d # or docker compose up -d
```

Make sure the port `3000` is exposed (on the hosting machine) to the outside and reach `/welcome` to setup your admin account.
