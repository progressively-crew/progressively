# Why Progressively?

There are plenty of great tools in the feature flagging space with their own sets of features and tradeoffs. Progressively has been built by developpers that have used some of these tools.

And we wanted to focus on some aspects that have not always been covered by others: **perceived performance, accessibility and privacy**.
