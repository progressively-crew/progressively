Progressively introduces a dynamic funnel feature, ingeniously designed to bridge the interaction between feature flags evaluation and user-triggered events within a website.

This functionality capitalizes on the power of anonymous session tracking to construct detailed user journeys from a specified starting point to a designated final step.

By enabling the creation of these custom funnels, Progressively offers invaluable insights into how users navigate through a sequence of actions, highlighting the pathways that lead to conversions.

This detailed visualization of the user's journey not only aids in identifying potential bottlenecks that may hinder conversion rates but also enables precise adjustments to the website's features or content.

Ultimately, this funnel feature is instrumental for businesses aiming to optimize their conversion strategy, providing a clear, data-driven blueprint of user engagement patterns and conversion efficacy.
