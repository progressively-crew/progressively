## Overview

Imagine your product is a bustling metropolis, with features as its buildings and user interactions as its roads 🏙️.

Now, to understand and enhance the flow of traffic 🚃 – your users' journeys – you're equipped with four essential tools.

**Quantitative analytics** act as your high-tech traffic counters, measuring the volume of cars and their speed, giving you a bird's-eye view of which roads are most traveled.

**Qualitative analytics** are your street interviews, revealing why certain paths are favored and how the journey feels for the travelers.

**Feature flags** serve as your experimental detours 🚧, allowing you to test new routes on a small scale before opening them to the public.

**And event funneling** is your map 🗺️, showing the most common paths taken and highlighting bottlenecks. Together, these tools empower you to make data-driven decisions, optimizing the city's layout for smoother traffic, happier commuters, and a more vibrant metropolis.
