    <Feature title="Audience Targeting" href="/audience.png">
      With Progressively, you can define <strong>very granular rules</strong> based
      on users attributes to define who is supposed to get access to the new feature.
      It also includes <strong>gradual rollouts</strong> using percentage ranges.
    </Feature>

    <Feature title="Single & Multi Variants" href="/variants.png">
      By default, <strong>a feature can be visible or not visible</strong>. With
      Progressively, you can define <strong>other variants</strong> to provide different
      variations of your features to different users. It's useful for <strong
        >A/B testing</strong
      >.
    </Feature>

    <Feature title="Segments of users" href="/segments.png">
      Creating granular rules might be a long and repetitive task. Segments of
      users allows <strong
        >to group a set of rules targeting a set of users</strong
      > under the same entitiy. And it can also be used as a targeting rule. For
      instance, you can give your <strong>QA team an early access</strong> to the
      feature in production without repeating the rule.
    </Feature>

    <Feature title="Activation scheduling" href="/schedule.png">
      You want to activate (or deactivate) your feature flag on Tuesday 2pm PST
      but you live in Europe and you don't want to wake up? <strong
        >We have flag activation scheduling for you</strong
      >.
    </Feature>

    <Feature title="Flag insights" href="/insights.png">
      Each time a user is making a request to Progressively for evaluating the
      status of a flag, <strong>this evaluation is registered</strong>. In
      addition to that, you can define <strong>your own metrics</strong> and we cross
      the information between the flag evaluation and the metrics hits in dashboards.
