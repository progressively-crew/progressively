_From ideation to the end user, how much time is spent before being able to receive a user feedback?_

As a software company, our goal is to create products to make people lifes easier. In all of these different products, there is a bunch of features that are made available through user friendly interfaces so that the end users can achieve what they want to.

From my experience, features come from "product people".

In occasional cases, the developpers are included in these sessions
