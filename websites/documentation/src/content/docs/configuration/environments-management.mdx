## What is environment management?

When working on an application, it's conveniant to be able to use a given feature in an environment that is not production, mostly for testing stuff and experiment.

## How to do that with Progressively?

In Progressively, environment management is made through [Targeting Rules](./targeting-rules).

For instance, using the React SDK, it would look like:

```jsx
const YourPage = () => {
  return (
    <ProgressivelyProvider
      clientKey="YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"
      fields={{
        environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
        // put your attributes here
      }}
    >
      <FlaggedComponent />
    </ProgressivelyProvider>
  );
};

```

You can now use the `environment` attribute when defining rules and strategies in the dashboard.
