$ pip install sdk-progressively
```

## Usage <a href="#usage" id="usage"></a>

### Create an SDK instance

```python
from sdk.progressively import Progressively

sdk = Progressively.create("YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_KEY", "http://localhost:4000")
```

The SDK can receive an additional fields option.

**fields** is an option that allows passing data about your users to restrain the audience eligibility. For instance, you can set an email field, and in Progressively's dashboard, you can create a rule that only targets people that matches that field:

```python
fields = {"email": "john.doe@email.com", "id": 1}
sdk = Progressively.create("YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_KEY", "http://localhost:4000", fields)
```

### Evaluate

Retrieve the status of a given flag by its key.

```python
sdk.evaluate("theFlagKey")
```

### loadFlags

Makes an HTTP request to the Progressively server to retrieve the status of the flags.

```python
sdk.loadFlags()
```

sdk = Progressively.create("YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_KEY", "http://localhost:4000", fields)
