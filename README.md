## Get started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively
$ cd progressively
$ mv ./packages/backend/.env.example ./packages/backend/.env
$ mv ./packages/frontend/.env.example ./packages/frontend/.env
$ docker-compose up -d
```

You can now open http://localhost:3000/welcome to create your admin user.

## How is progressively different

- Progressively is smaller than its competitors ([1.3kB for the React SDK](https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively/tree/master/example/bundle-diffs))
- Progressively has an accessible dashboard (if you face issues, please [create an issue](https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively/issues))
- Progressively comes with built-in SSR support so that the page don't blink when resolving the flags
- Real-time propagation with Websockets
- No intrusive tracking (expect [Sentry](sentry.io/) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) to be added at some point so that we understand more the audience)
- Self-hosted so that you own the data
