# Simple insights

Progressively is privacy first. We dont track our users. What we can however do is to record how many times a flag has been evaluated over time.

A flag evaluation corresponds to the resolution of the value provided to the flag from Progressively's server. It basically determines whether the user will resolve the `true` or `false` variation.

This is something that is anonymously recorded and provided in forms of a simple bar chart, per date range.
