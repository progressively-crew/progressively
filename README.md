## Overview

Imagine your product is a bustling metropolis, with features as its buildings and user interactions as its roads üèôÔ∏è.

Now, to understand and enhance the flow of traffic üöÉ ‚Äì your users' journeys ‚Äì you're equipped with four essential tools.

**Quantitative analytics** act as your high-tech traffic counters, measuring the volume of cars and their speed, giving you a bird's-eye view of which roads are most traveled.

**Qualitative analytics** are your street interviews, revealing why certain paths are favored and how the journey feels for the travelers.

**Feature flags** serve as your experimental detours üöß, allowing you to test new routes on a small scale before opening them to the public.

**And event funneling** is your map üó∫Ô∏è, showing the most common paths taken and highlighting bottlenecks. Together, these tools empower you to make data-driven decisions, optimizing the city's layout for smoother traffic, happier commuters, and a more vibrant metropolis.

## Roadmap

### Feature flags

- [x] Single variant feature flag (e.g: `true` or `false`)
- [x] Multi variants feature flags (e.g: `Control`, `A`, `B`, you name it)
- [x] Flag activation based on date & time (`before the`, `after the`, `always`)
- [x] Progressively rollout (from `0%` to `100%` of the target audience)
- [x] Attribute based targeting (you provide a couple fields/value and can restrict flag evaluation for these couples)
- [x] Webhooks triggering on flag toggle
- [x] Insights on variants evaluated by your audience over time
- [x] Real time update with websockets (opt-in) in the JS sdk
- [x] SSR SDK for frameworks like Remix, Nextjs etc...
