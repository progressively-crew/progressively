description: How to deploy Progressively to Render?
---

## Prerequisite

- A connection string to a Postgres database (you can use [Neondb](https://neon.tech/) for example)
- A connection string to a Postgres shadow database (you can use [Neondb](https://neon.tech/) for example)
- A connection string to a Redis database (you can use [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for example)
- An account on [Render](https://render.com/)


## Steps

Make sure to have the Postgres & Redis connection strings close to you.

### Setup the backend (APIs)

- Open https://dashboard.render.com/
- Click the `New +` button at the top right of the screen
- In the dropdown, select `Web service`
- Select the `Deploy an existing image from a registry` option and click `Next`
- Paste the following (public) image from the hub: `marvinfrachet/progressively-backend:latest`, and click `Next`
- On the pricing page, fill the information you need (I use a free plan for example).
- At the bottom of the pricing page, you will have to fill the different environment variables of [this .env file](https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively/blob/master/websites/backend/.env.example) **with your own values. Put your connection strings in these inputs.**
