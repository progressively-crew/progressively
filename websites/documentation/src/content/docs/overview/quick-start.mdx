This guide will help you set up your first feature flag and get started with our powerful feature management platform.

## Step 1: Create an Account on the Dashboard

1. [Visit Progressively Dashboard Registration to create your account](https://dashboard.progressively.app/register).
2. Check your email for an activation link and follow the instructions to activate your account.
3. Once activated, log in to your new account and begin creating your first project as part of the onboarding process.

## Step 2: Create Your First Feature Flag

1. Navigate to your project home
2. Navigate to the **Feature Flags tab**
3. Create a New Feature Flag:

    - Click on the **Add a feature flag** button.
    - Provide a name and description for your feature flag.
    - Click "Save" to create your feature flag.


Your feature flag is now created and ready to be used in your application ðŸŽ‰.

## Step 3: Integrate an SDK
_This example uses the React SDK but feel free to navigate the SDK section of this website to find the one that fits your needs._

Integrate Progressively's SDK into your application to start using the feature flags.

1. Install the SDK

```sh
$ pnpm add @progressively/react
```

2. Setup the Provider

```jsx
import { ProgressivelyProvider } from '@progressively/react';

const YourPage = () => {
  return (
    <ProgressivelyProvider clientKey="your-client-key">
      <FlaggedComponent />
    </ProgressivelyProvider>
  );
};
```

_You can find your client key in your project's settings._

3. Use the feature flag in your component

```jsx
import {  useFlags } from "@progressively/react";

const FlaggedComponent = () => {
  const { flags } = useFlags();

  if (flags.myFlagKey) {
    return <div>New page!</div>;
  }

  return <div>Old page</div>;
};
```

4. You're ready ðŸŽ‰! Play with the toggle and configuration options of your feature flag and see what's happening :D.
