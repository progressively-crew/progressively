# Schedules flag update

> This feature is only available for single variant feature flags for now. A new iteration will come in the future to make scheduled updates work for multi-variants feature flags.

With Progressively, you can define scheduled updates at the feature flag level.

For example, it's possible to schedule flag updates for:

- swiching **ON** the `newLoginPage` feature flag on **Monday** next week at **10am** for **10%** of the audience
- swiching **ON** the `newLoginPage` feature flag on **Tuesday** next week at **9am** for **20%** of the audience
- swiching **ON** the `newLoginPage` feature flag on **Wednesday** next week at **6am** for **50%** of the audience
- swiching **OFF** the `newLoginPage` feature flag on **Friday** next week at **5pm**
