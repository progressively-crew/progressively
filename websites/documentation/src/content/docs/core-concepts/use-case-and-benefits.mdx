## Use cases

### Gradual Rollouts

Release new features to a small percentage of users to monitor performance and gather feedback before a full-scale launch.

_Example: A new user interface is rolled out to 10% of users to ensure it functions correctly and is well-received before making it available to everyone_

### A/B Testing

Run experiments by exposing different user segments to different variations of a feature to determine which version performs better.

_Example: Testing two versions of a signup form to see which one results in higher conversion rates._

### Canary Releases

Deploy new features to a specific subset of users or environments to identify potential issues before broader deployment.

_Example: Rolling out a new payment gateway to internal users for testing before releasing it to all customers._

### Instant Rollbacks

Quickly disable a feature if issues are detected in production without requiring a new deployment.

_Example: Disabling a newly released feature that causes unexpected errors or performance degradation._

### Operational Control

Allow operations teams to manage feature availability in response to system health and performance.

_Example: Temporarily disabling a resource-intensive feature during peak traffic periods to maintain system stability._

### User Segmentation

Enable or disable features for specific user groups based on demographics, behavior, or other criteria.

_Example: Enabling a beta feature for users who have opted into a beta testing program._

## Benefits of Using Feature Flags

### Continuous Delivery

Feature flags enable continuous delivery by decoupling feature deployment from code releases. This allows teams to deploy code to production more frequently and safely.

_Example: Deploying code with new features hidden behind flags, which can be turned on when ready for user exposure._

### Reduced Risk

Gradual rollouts and instant rollbacks help mitigate the risk associated with deploying new features. Teams can identify and resolve issues before they impact all users.
 
_Example: Rolling out a new feature to 5% of users to monitor for any critical bugs before a wider release._

### Increased Agility

Feature flags allow for more flexible and rapid iteration on features. Teams can test and adjust features based on real user feedback without waiting for the next release cycle.

_Example: Quickly tweaking a new feature based on feedback from beta testers, then enabling it for a larger audience._

### Improved Collaboration

Different teams (e.g., development, QA, product management) can work independently yet cohesively. Developers can deploy new code while QA and product teams control the visibility of new features.

_Example: Developers deploy a new feature controlled by a flag, and QA toggles the flag to test it in a staging environment without needing a new deployment._

### Better User Experience

By rolling out features gradually and gathering feedback, teams can ensure a higher quality user experience. Issues can be addressed quickly, and features can be optimized based on user data.

_Example: Gradually rolling out a new search feature and using user feedback to refine its functionality before a full release._
