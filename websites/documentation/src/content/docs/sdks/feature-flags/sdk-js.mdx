## Installation

```shell
$ npm install --save @progressively/sdk-js
```

## Usage

### Create an SDK instance

```javascript
import { Progressively } from "@progressively/sdk-js";

// These options are only necessary when self hosting
const options = {
  apiUrl: "your url server",
  websocketUrl: "your url server for websockets",
};

const sdk = Progressively.init("YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_KEY", options);
```

The `options` object can also receive other (optional) attributes such as **fields** and **flags**

**fields** is an option that allows passing data about your users to restrain the audience eligibility. For instance, you can set an email field, and in Progressively's dashboard, you can create a rule that only targets people that matches that field:

```javascript
// These options are only necessary when self hosting
const options = {
  apiUrl: "your url server",
  websocketUrl: "your url server for websockets",
  fields: {
    email: "@progressively.com",
  },
};
```

**flags** is an option that is mostly used for server-side rendering. You should not directly use it in your code, except if you are building a server integration that does not yet.

### Load the flags

Makes an HTTP request to the Progressively server to retrieve the status of the flags.

```javascript
sdk.loadFlags();
```

### Listen to WebSockets updates

Start WebSockets update for realtime subscriptions. `websocketUrl` should be passed for this method to work.

```javascript
sdk.onFlagUpdate((nextFlags) => {}, optionalUserId);
```

### Disconnect the WebSockets

Explicitly disconnect the websocket.

```javascript
sdk.disconnect();
```
