The project is Open Source and the entire codebase can be browsed and audited. If you have any particular questions, or if you think this document is lacking information, we (the team behind Progressively) will be more than happy to update it.

## What Information Progressively Collects and Why

### Website browser data

If you're using the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect such as cookies and web server logs. Everybody is concerned.

The information we collect about all users of our app for logs purpose includes:

- IP address

### Why Do We Collect This?

We collect this information to monitor and make sure everything runs as expected in the website.

To get access to Progressively's dashboard, users have to create an account requiring a valid email address, a password and a username.

### Why Do We Collect This?

We use these information to create targeting rules for feature flags evaluation.

This information is provided by you and only you, and you acknowledge that you are the only responsible entity for the storage of these data, even more if they are sensitive. Progressively cannot be held responsible for the storage of this data.

We do not host advertising on Progressively. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show.

We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.

## Our Use of Cookies and Tracking

### Cookies

Progressively uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in.

Progressively also uses cookies to store a randomly generated unique identifier to provide the same navigation experience to the user on subsequent sessions after feature flags have been evaluated.

### Tracking

We track flags evaluations. A flag evaluation correspond to the computation of a feature flag value from a randomly generated unique identifier. We store flag evaluation to provide you with insights regarding how you application behaves when a feature flag is used. This flag evaluation contains the generated ID and this generated can't be used to identify a person: it's randomly generated and associated with no additional data.

Also, in Progressively, it's possible to create "metrics". You can get navigation information and insights based on these. For instance, you can `track the metric "Click CTA" on the Hero button` and get this data in the dashboard. This metric hit does not contain data that can identify a person.

In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Progressively strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.
