# The Demo instance

It is now possible to play with Progressively in a demo instance, without the need to install anything :tada: .

You can now create an account on [https://frontend-progressively.fly.dev/](https://frontend-progressively.fly.dev/) and connect your application using one of the SDKs to get a taste of the tool.

Enjoy, and let us know what you think of it :blush:.

> :warning: Keep in mind that this is a demo-only instance. It does not aim to be used for production application. The data will be deleted quite often and you can expect latency since the underlying machine are not optimized for a production usage.
