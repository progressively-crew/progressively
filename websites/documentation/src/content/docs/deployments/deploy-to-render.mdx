description: How to deploy Progressively to Render?
---

## Prerequisite

- A connection string to a Postgres database (you can use [Neondb](https://neon.tech/) for example)
- A connection string to a Postgres shadow database (you can use [Neondb](https://neon.tech/) for example)
- A connection string to a Redis database (you can use [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for example)
- A connection string to a [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/) database (you can use the online service or the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/clickhouse/clickhouse-server/))
- An account on [Render](https://render.com/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on the machine


## Steps

Make sure to have the Postgres & Redis connection strings close to you.

### Prepare the database

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively
$ cd progressively
$ cp ./packages/database/.env.example ./packages/database/.env # modify the .env file with the connection string to postgres
$ cp ./websites/backend/.env.example ./websites/backend/.env # modify the .env file with the connection string to postgres & Redis
$ cp ./websites/frontend/.env.example ./websites/frontend/.env
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm run build
$ pnpm run db:prepare
```

_This step might disappear or be reduced in the future. We know it's not optimal._

### Setup the backend (APIs)

- Open https://dashboard.render.com/
- Click the `New +` button at the top right of the screen
- In the dropdown, select `Web service`
- Select the `Deploy an existing image from a registry` option and click `Next`
- Paste the following (public) image from the hub: `marvinfrachet/progressively-backend:latest`, and click `Next`
- On the pricing page, fill the information you need (I use a free plan for example).
- At the bottom of the pricing page, you will have to fill the different environment variables of [this .env file](https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively/blob/master/websites/backend/.env.example) **with your own values. Put your connection strings in these inputs.**

### Next steps

The services are ready. You can now:

- Open the frontend url on `/welcome` to create your admin user
- Choose a SDK and integrate it in your application
