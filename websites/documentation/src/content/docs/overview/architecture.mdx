description: The overall architecture of Progressively
---


Progressively is designed to be a robust and scalable feature flags management platform. Here’s a high-level overview of its architecture:

## Core pieces

**1. Dashboard**

The web-based dashboard where users create, manage, and monitor feature flags.

**2. APIs and backend services**

The backend service that handles requests from the dashboard, processes them, and updates the database accordingly.

**3. SDKs**

Available for various programming languages and frameworks, these libraries interact with the API server to check feature flag statuses and handle targeting rules within your application.

**4. Databases**

Stores projects, feature flag configurations, user segments, and targeting rules etc.

## High level overview

### How Progressively Evaluates Feature Flags

Progressively evaluates feature flags on the server. This means that your SDK will make an HTTP request to the server to receive the actual values of the feature flags.

### Benefits of Server-Side Evaluation

This server-side approach helps to reduce the size of your client-side bundles. For instance, **the React SDK for Progressively is only 1.3kB**, whereas **some other tools can be as large as 40kB**, potentially impacting your application’s performance.

### Efficiency and Performance

Given the need for server round-trips and server-side calculations, Progressively is designed to be highly efficient at the server level. Here’s how it achieves this:

- **Kafka Integration**: Progressively leverages Kafka to offload as much computation as possible for later processing, ensuring only the necessary calculations are performed immediately.
- **Redis Caching**: Progressively aggressively uses Redis to cache feature flag evaluations and billing details, minimizing any noticeable delays.

## Fun fact

With Redis and asynchronous computations handling your remaining credits, you will always have the exact number of events you purchased, plus an extra set of events (1-10 more than what you bought).
