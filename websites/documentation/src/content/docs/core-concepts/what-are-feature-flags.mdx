description: Explanation of what feature flags are

Feature flags, also known as feature toggles, are a powerful technique in software development that allows teams to enable or disable features in an application without deploying new code.
This is achieved by encapsulating feature-related code within conditional statements that check the status of a feature flag.

## How Feature Flags Work

**1. Definition**

A feature flag is a boolean variable (or a variable that contains one single value) that determines whether a particular feature is enabled or disabled.

**2. Control**

Feature flags can be controlled dynamically through a management interface or programmatically via an API.

**3. Evaluation**

The application code evaluates the status of the feature flag at runtime and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

For example:

```javascript
if (featureFlag.isFeatureActivated) {
    // Execute code for the new feature
} else {
    // Execute code for the existing functionality
}
```
## Types of Feature Flags

**1. Release Flags**

Control the release of new features, allowing teams to deploy code to production without immediately exposing the new functionality to users.

**2. Experiment Flags**

Used for A/B testing and experimentation, enabling different experiences for different user segments.

**3. Ops Flags**

Provide operational control over features, allowing for quick rollbacks or disabling of features in response to issues.

**4. Permission Flags**

Control access to features based on user roles or permissions.
