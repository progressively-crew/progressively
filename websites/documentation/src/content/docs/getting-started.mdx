Progressively is a straightforward, lightweight, open-source, and self-hosted feature flag and analytics software. It streamlines feature releases with the simplicity of toggling a switch. Additionally, it provides a privacy-friendly analytics tool to help you better understand the impact of your feature flags.

To get accustomed to the functionalities existing in the project, we recommend to take a look at the following sections:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard

    description="Feature flags let you turn features on or off with just a click."
    href="/concepts/features-flags"
  />

  <LinkCard
    title="Quantitative analytics"
    description="Collect details about the page being looked at, and include extra activities to learn more about your audience's actions."
    href="/concepts/anonymous-analytics"
  />

  <LinkCard
